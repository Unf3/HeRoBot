This mod is made for datapack makers to make bots that can fight back

The bots have a much higher parity with a vanilla client compared to carpet, with things like Auto-Jump and the spear working.

<details>
<summary>Bot Player</summary>

Bot players are fake players that join the server and can be controlled entirely through commands. They are spawned with `/playerspawn` and controlled with `/player`. Bot players have correct server-side behavior for combat, movement, and item usage.

Bot players automatically respawn on death with full health, empty inventory, and no XP (unless `botLeaveOnDeath` is enabled).

<details>
<summary><code>/playerspawn</code></summary>

Spawns a bot player with optional position, rotation, gamemode, and dimension.

- `/playerspawn <name>` - spawns at the executor's position
- `/playerspawn <name> at <pos>` - spawns at a specific position
- `/playerspawn <name> at <pos> facing <rotation>` - spawns with specific yaw/pitch
- `/playerspawn <name> at <pos> facing <cardinal>` - spawns facing a cardinal direction (`north`, `south`, `east`, `west`, `up`, `down`)
- `/playerspawn <name> ... in <gamemode>` - spawns in a specific gamemode (defaults to creative)
- `/playerspawn <name> ... on <dimension>` - spawns in a specific dimension

Prevents duplicate names. Respects whitelist and bans. Spectators spawn flying, survival players spawn grounded.

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>/player</code></summary>

Controls bot players using action packs. All subcommands target with `/player <targets> ...` and support selectors for targeting multiple bots.

<details>
<summary><code>use</code>, <code>attack</code>, <code>swing</code>, <code>jump</code>, <code>drop</code>, <code>dropStack</code>, <code>swapHands</code></summary>

Action commands that make the bot perform player actions.

- `/player <targets> <action>` - stops that action
- `/player <targets> <action> once` - performs the action once
- `/player <targets> <action> continuous` - performs the action every tick
- `/player <targets> <action> interval <ticks>` - performs the action every N ticks

`use` without parameters stops using without triggering another use (unlike carpet where it behaved like `use once`).

`swing` swings a hand without performing an action and resets the attack cooldown.

`attack` with a spear/kinetic weapon will perform a stab action instead.

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>autojump</code></summary>

Controls automatic jumping over one-block obstacles while moving

- `/player <targets> autojump` - attempts a single autojump (jumps if the bot is moving and would need to step up)
- `/player <targets> autojump true` - enables continuous autojump
- `/player <targets> autojump false` - disables continuous autojump

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>move</code></summary>

Controls bot movement direction.

- `/player <targets> move` - stops all movement
- `/player <targets> move forward`
- `/player <targets> move backward`
- `/player <targets> move left`
- `/player <targets> move right`

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>sneak</code> / <code>sprint</code></summary>

- `/player <targets> sneak` - starts sneaking
- `/player <targets> unsneak` - stops sneaking
- `/player <targets> sprint` - starts sprinting
- `/player <targets> unsprint` - stops sprinting

Sneaking slows movement to 30% speed. Using an item (non-spear) slows to 20% speed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>look</code></summary>

Controls where the bot is looking. Most look commands support `delta <ticks>` for smooth transitions over multiple ticks.

**Cardinal Directions**
- `/player <targets> look north|south|east|west|up|down`
- `/player <targets> look north delta <ticks>`

**Exact Rotation**
- `/player <targets> look <yaw> <pitch>`
- `/player <targets> look <yaw> <pitch> delta <ticks>`

**Relative Turns**
- `/player <targets> look left` - turns 90 degrees left
- `/player <targets> look right` - turns 90 degrees right
- `/player <targets> look back` - turns 180 degrees
- `/player <targets> look relative <rotation>` - turns by the given relative rotation
- All support `delta <ticks>`

**Look at Position**
- `/player <targets> look at <pos>`
- `/player <targets> look at <pos> delta <ticks>`

**Look at Entity**
- `/player <targets> look upon <entity>` - looks at the entity's eyes (default)
- `/player <targets> look upon <entity> eyes` - looks at the entity's eyes
- `/player <targets> look upon <entity> feet` - looks at the entity's feet
- `/player <targets> look upon <entity> closest` - looks at the closest point of the entity's hitbox
- All support `delta <ticks>`

**Random**
- `/player <targets> look random` - looks in a random direction

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>hotbar</code></summary>

Selects a hotbar slot.

- `/player <targets> hotbar <slot>` - selects slot 1 through 9

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>itemCd</code></summary>

Controls item cooldowns.

- `/player <targets> itemCd` - resets all item cooldowns (returns how many were reset)
- `/player <targets> itemCd <item>` - shows remaining cooldown ticks (returns tick count)
- `/player <targets> itemCd <item> reset` - resets the cooldown for that item
- `/player <targets> itemCd <item> set` - applies the item's default cooldown without using it
- `/player <targets> itemCd <item> set <ticks>` - applies a custom cooldown duration

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>ping</code></summary>

Controls the bot's simulated ping. Knockback is delayed by the equivalent number of ticks based on the `botPingToTicks` setting.

- `/player <targets> ping` - shows the bot's current ping and equivalent tick delay
- `/player <targets> ping <value>` - sets the ping in milliseconds (suggested: 0, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200)

The tick delay has some randomness when the ping doesn't divide evenly by `botPingToTicks`. For example, with ping 30 and botPingToTicks 25, there is a 5/25 chance each tick to add 1 extra tick of delay.

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>copycat</code></summary>

Copies another player's inventory and action pack onto the bot.

- `/player <targets> copycat <source>`

- `/player <targets> skin leftSleeve`
- `/player <targets> skin rightSleeve`
- `/player <targets> skin leftPant`
- `/player <targets> skin rightPant`
- `/player <targets> skin hat`

Each call toggles the part on/off.

Left/Right Handedness:
- `/player <targets> handedness left`
- `/player <targets> handedness right`

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>stop</code> / <code>kill</code> / <code>disconnect</code></summary>

- `/player <targets> kill` - kills the bot (triggers death and respawn)
- `/player <targets> disconnect` - removes the bot from the server without a death

</details>

</details>
